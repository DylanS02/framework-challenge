            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <div class="rules-content">
                <h3>Basic Rules of Chess</h3>
                <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. Each player controls an army of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>King:</strong> Moves one square in any direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Moves any number of vacant squares in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves any number of vacant squares diagonally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an 'L' shape: two squares in a horizontal or vertical direction, then one square perpendicular. Can jump over other pieces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves forward one square, with the option to move two squares if they have not yet moved. Pawns capture one square diagonally forward. Upon reaching the opposite side of the board, a pawn can be promoted to any other piece (except king).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Castling:</strong> A special move involving the king and either rook, which moves the king two squares towards the rook and the rook to the square over which the king crossed.</li>
                    <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture that can occur when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check and Checkmate:</strong> When a king is in a position to be captured on the next move, it is in check. If there is no way to move the king out of capture, it is checkmate, and the game is over.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stalemate:</strong> A situation where a player has no legal move and their king is not in check. This results in a draw.</li>
                </ul>
